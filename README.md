E-Commerce Gender Prediction and Personalization Enhancement Using Hyperparameter-Tuned Random Forest and LightGBM

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance e-commerce personalization by accurately predicting customer gender. Using hyperparameter-tuned models such as Random Forest and LightGBM, we tackle the challenge of gender-based recommendation systems.

## Models Used
-Logistic regression
- Random Forest
- LightGBM
- Adaboost
- XG Boost

Both models have been fine-tuned for optimal performance.
